    "Ans:The main difference is that **`read()`** will read the whole file at once and then print out the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis Whereas the `readline()` that will read and print out only the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis. You may want to use readline() when you're reading files that are too big for your RAM. The `read()` would treat each character in the file separately, meaning that the iteration would happen for every character.\n",
    "The `readline()` function, on the other hand, only reads a single line of the file. This means that if the first line of the file were three lines long, the readline() function would only parse (or iterate/operate) on the first line of the file."
